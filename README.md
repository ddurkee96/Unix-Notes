# Unix-Notes

This is a compilations of notes that I took while taking
an online Unix Workbench (by John Hopkins University course) on Coursera.
I've done my best to avoid putting any quiz/exercise answers in my notes
since my notes are public.

I've categorized the notes by different topics, similar to the
different chapters in the course.

Feel free to reference these notes if they are helpful to you.
